# MyPasswordaManager
An attempt to do a password manager with not familiar languages.
I will be using Python for my "Frontend", making use of tkinter.
SQLite is going to be the laguage for the DB.
I will use C with the sqlite3 library in order to make the queries as i have never done that wihtout Java or using PostgreSQL.
Finally I will use GO to generate random passwords.

Any idea to improve the project is welcome :)

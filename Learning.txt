Things I learned:
  Using Python-Tkinter:
  - A bit of a problem in the beggining getting used to everything but it has similar arguments to CSS in order to assing color, fonts, padding etc.
  - Python is simple yet effective, I think it has some things I like less than C/C++ or C# (maybe its because I am more familiar with those) but its a language that doesn't give you a hard time. I would probably use it again in another project.

  Communicating C <-> Python:
  - Passing a char* from C to Python is complicated to do safely freeing afterwards the pointer, solution found: 
    Using Python Library in C and "Wrapping" the original C function with another function so I can free the pointer in C and send back a PyObject which Pyhton will turn into a string.

  Communicating C <-> SQLite:
  - How to query, pass values, receive values from SQLite in C. Some things are similar to Quering from JAVA as I have done in Uni(Not a lot really), but there are more calls in order to pass values and receive I feel.
    Luckily tables being so easy there are no difficoult queries.

  Communicating C <-> GO:
  - How to compile a Go file and getting to use the Go functions from C. It was easier than I thought it would be.

  Using Go for the first time:
  - Pretty similar to C in terms of syntax and how to define things, also reminded me of Zig or Rust because of having to add the return value in the end instead of defining it at the begining like in C/C++.

  Creating Passwords with Go:
  - I decided to make use of random passwords instead of hashed passphrases for example as it is harder to brute force attack.
